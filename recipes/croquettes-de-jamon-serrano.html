        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>With only a handful of ingredients, my mother-in-law’s traditional Spanish ham croquettes recipe is the best I’ve ever
            tried. In only 30 minutes you can whip up a batch of croquette dough too. It’s easier than you might think!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Serrano Ham: In Spain, we make these croquettes using cured jamón — either Serrano (most common) or Iberian. Read about
            the differences here. You can substitute the ham of your choice — prosciutto works well but any high-quality ham will be
            delicious.
            </li>
            <li>Butter: While some recipes use only olive oil, I think that the butter makes the filling much more light and creamy. I’d
            recommend a mix of butter and extra virgin olive oil as my recipe instructs, but you could do 100% oil or 100% butter if
            you prefer.
            </li>
            <li>Oil: Use the best quality you can — preferably extra virgin olive oil. In Spain, we also fry our croquettes in olive
            oil, but any neutral frying oil will do if you must substitute.
            </li>
            <li>Flour: I have never experimented using different flours (or gluten-free ones) but I have heard of people being
            successful with a good GF blend. If you try it, leave us a comment below!
            </li>
            <li>Onion: Traditional croquetas always incorporate onion. You could substitute shallots or leeks.</li>
            <li>Milk: Use whole milk, preferably at room temperature. This is not the recipe to try to cut calories!</li>
            <li>Bread Crumbs: Use the bread crumbs of your choice. I personally love making croquettes with panko bread crumbs — they
            get super crispy!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>The Douhg</h4>
        <p>The dough for ham croquettes is really easy to make. You just need about 30 minutes and a strong arm. Let’s go!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Steps 1-2: Start by heating the butter and oil in a heavy pan. When fully melted and hot, add the onions and sauté for
            about five minutes — until just starting to color.
            </li>
            <li>Steps 3-6: Next, add the nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Mix and then add the diced Serrano ham and cook for no more than a
            minute. Add the flour and sauté, mixing constantly to cook the flour as much as possible without burning it. Once it is
            browned a bit (photo 6) it’s time to add the milk.
            </li>
            <li>Steps 7-8: Now begin to add the milk, little by little, over the next 15-20 minutes. Every time the mixture gets dry,
            add some more milk. Stir constantly, and once the dough is creamy and thick (photo 8) it’s ready to cool.
            </li>
            <li>Steps 9-10: Pour the croquette dough into a large bowl and let it cool to room temperature. Cover it with plastic wrap
            (directly on the dough) and store it in the fridge for at least four hours (but ideally overnight). When it’s cool, take
            it out of the fridge and make little croquette logs using a metal spoon for help.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Breading and Frying</h4>
        <p>When the dough is completely chilled and you’ve formed your croquette logs, it’s time to bread and fry them!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Steps 1-4: First, prepare flour, beaten eggs, and bread crumbs in separate bowls. This is a simple three step breading
            process: cover in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs. Place on top of wax paper if you wish so they don’t stick.
            </li>
            <li>Steps 5-6: Finally, it’s time to fry your croquettes! Heat olive oil in a heavy frying pan and once hot (but not
            smoking) add the croquettes. Turn them mid way to ensure they brown evenly on all sides. They should take about five
            minutes to fry. Remove and resist the urge to bite in right away (you don’t want to burn yourself!). After about five
            minutes give them a try!
